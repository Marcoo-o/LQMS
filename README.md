# Value Proposition Canvas

Das hier w√ºrde ich auf jeden Fall auf Deutsch machen

## Value Map

- Gain creators (how the product / service creates customer gain)
- Pain reliever (how the product / service allevaites customer pain)
- Product + Services (product / services that gets the customers' job done)

## Customer Profile

- Gains (what customer wants to achieve)
- Jobs to be done (tasks, problems, needs of the customer)
- Pains (?)
